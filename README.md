# Introduction

From the abbreviation of the word "Traceability", Tracy is born. A startup idea that aiming to utilize  Internet Computer Protocol technology to define an application capable of tracing the entire supply chain of a fashion house, offering consumers the opportunity to discover the history of their purchases, delve into the production processes, and directly verify the quality of the chosen product. The objective is to highlight, and consequently protect, the "Made in Italy" label in an industry where it is often misused, by making transparent information that is difficult to access through other means today.

# Individual Contribution: dApp development

During the initial stages of the project, the theoretical and administrative framework of the idea was outlined through the drafting of a detailed white paper. Additionally, exemplar code was implemented to reproduce the basic functionalities envisioned in Tracy. However, the work accomplished thus far has left the door open to an intriguing challenge: completing the application as a whole, a task I have personally undertaken.

## Implemented Features and Workflow

- **Supplier Portal**: Suppliers registering and uploading documents attesting to their quality, and corresponding database rows for orders from other suppliers
- **Fashion House Interface**: Fashion houses selecting suppliers belonging to their supply chain through the dedicated interface
- **Consumer Interface**: Consumers entering a product into the search portal and viewing the suppliers belonging to the supply chain for that product
- **Made in Italy Ranking**: Consumers can check the ranking of the best suppliers, based on points given to their uploaded information
